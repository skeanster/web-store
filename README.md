# Fake E-Commerce Store built with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What this is:

This project is a multi page react application built to test my state management and design skills.
Add items to your cart and watch the navbar re-render to update the total. View your items on the cart page and add/delete them. The navbar, item total, and cart total will all re-render to show the accurate amount

## What I learned:

React App routing, managing state multiple pages, passing state through mutliple components
